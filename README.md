This project is a web application developed with Streamlit that predicts the Iris flower type based on its physical features. It utilizes a Random Forest classification model trained on the well-known Iris dataset. The app allows users to adjust parameters of the Iris flower (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and view the model's prediction.

## Features
- Interactive interface for inputting flower parameters.
- Prediction probability visualization using interactive Plotly bar charts.
- Custom styling with CSS for an enhanced visual experience.
